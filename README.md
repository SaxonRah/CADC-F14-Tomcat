# CADC-F14-Tomcat

idk, thought it would be fun to replicate the CADC from the F14 Tomcat in Verilog

i doubt this will go anywhere, or even compile if i get that far. 
this is an extremely difficult project with tons of liberties taken from a lack of information/documentation.
reverse engineering the die photos will be the most accurate path instead of relying on the reports/manuals information.
